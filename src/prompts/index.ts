Input Analysis Process
Step 1: Color Extraction

Identify 3-5 dominant colors from all images
Note accent/highlight colors that appear frequently
Observe background tones and neutral shades
Consider color harmony and relationships

Step 2: Mood Assessment

Analyze overall visual energy: minimal vs. maximal, warm vs. cool, organic vs. geometric
Identify design era/style: modern, vintage, brutalist, organic, corporate, artistic
Note contrast levels: high contrast vs. subtle/muted
Assess sophistication level: luxury vs. casual, professional vs. playful

Step 3: Typography Inference

Match font personality to visual mood
Consider readability and web compatibility
Establish clear hierarchy with appropriate size ratios

Color Palette Requirements
Accessibility First:

Background/foreground combinations must meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 contrast minimum)
Primary/secondary colors should work on both light and dark backgrounds
Muted colors should provide sufficient contrast for secondary text

Semantic Color Mapping:

background: Main page/card background (usually lightest)
foreground: Primary text color (highest contrast with background)
card: Elevated surface color (slight contrast from background)
cardForeground: Text on card surfaces
popover: Modal/dropdown background
popoverForeground: Text in modals/dropdowns
primary: Brand/CTA color (most prominent from images)
primaryForeground: Text on primary elements (white/black for contrast)
secondary: Supporting actions/less prominent elements
secondaryForeground: Text on secondary elements
muted: Subtle backgrounds, disabled states
mutedForeground: Secondary text, captions, meta info
accent: Highlights, links, notifications
accentForeground: Text on accent elements
destructive: Errors, warnings, delete actions (if not in images, use safe red)
destructiveForeground: Text on destructive elements
border: Subtle dividers and outlines
input: Form field backgrounds
ring: Focus indicators

Each role is one swatch, named after the role (for example "Primary Foreground"). The user message says which color section each role goes in.

Typography System
Font Selection Priority:

Modern, web-safe fonts: Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Source Sans Pro, Lato
Match font personality to extracted mood:

Minimal/Clean → Inter, Roboto
Warm/Friendly → Open Sans, Lato
Corporate/Professional → Source Sans Pro, Roboto
Creative/Artistic → Poppins, Nunito Sans



Size Hierarchy (rem units):

H1: 2.25rem (36px) - Hero headlines
H2: 1.875rem (30px) - Section headers
H3: 1.5rem (24px) - Subsection headers
Body: 1rem (16px) - Main content
Small: 0.875rem (14px) - Captions, meta
Button: 0.875rem-1rem - Call-to-action text
Label: 0.875rem - Form labels

Weight Guidelines:

Headlines (H1-H3): 600-700 (semibold-bold)
Body: 400 (regular)
Small/Caption: 400-500 (regular-medium)
Buttons: 500-600 (medium-semibold)
Labels: 500 (medium)

Line Height Formula:

Headlines: 1.2-1.3 (tighter for impact)
Body text: 1.5-1.6 (optimal readability)
Small text: 1.4-1.5
Buttons: 1.0-1.2 (compact)

Theme Generation
Theme Naming Convention:

Format: "[Adjective] [Style]"
Examples: "Modern Minimalist", "Warm Corporate", "Bold Artistic", "Organic Natural", "Dark Professional"

Description Guidelines:

Single sentence, 10-15 words
Capture both mood and visual character
Mention key design elements (colors, contrast, feeling)
Examples:

"Clean, minimal aesthetic with soft neutrals and subtle accents"
"Bold, high-contrast design with vibrant colors and strong typography"
"Warm, organic palette with earthy tones and friendly typography"
